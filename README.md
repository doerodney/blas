# Basic Linear Algebra Subsystem (BLAS)

This project builds a BLAS to use for simple linear algebra tasks.  It is currently implemented for JavaScript, but could be eventually ported to other languages/cultures.

## JavaScript Implementation
The JavaScript (JS) code is implemented using test-driven development (TDD) using the Jasmine test framework.

To clone and begin development, it is necessary to:
* Clone this repository.
* Have node.js installed.
* `cd` to the `js` directory.
* Execute `npm install` to get dependencies.
* Execute `npm test` to run unit tests.
